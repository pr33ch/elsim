--------------------------------------------------
Build instructions:
  1) Set the makefile variable $MAINSRC to your desired top-level source file
     (containing main()). You can just uncomment one of the existing lines.
     The default top-level file is "test/adders.cpp".
  2) Run `make`.

Other build options:
  - `make debug` to include debugging printouts.
  - `make opt` to compile with optimization and turn off all debug features.
  - `make clean` to remove the simulator executable.

To run: `./elsim <args>`

--------------------------------------------------
Creating a simulation
--------------------------------------------------

See "test/adders.cpp" for an example.
You should include "sim.h" to have access to all the built-in modules.
The general steps are: declare a top-level module, set its inputs, and call its
simulate() method. Then print the outputs or write a VCD file using VCDWriter.

--------------------------------------------------
Built-in modules
--------------------------------------------------

This list is not exhaustive. See "src/sim.h".

The following classes derive from Module:
- AND,NAND,OR,NOR,XOR,XNOR,INV,BUF
    Standard logic gates with arbitrary number of inputs.
- FA,HA,GAP
    Full adder, half adder, generate-alive-propagate.
- MUX
    Multiplexer with two arbitrary-width inputs.
- CLK,REG,LATCH
    Clock pulse generator, register, transparent latch.

The following classes derive from SystemModule:
- MetaGate
    Composite gate with arbitrary-width inputs.
    e.g. MetaGate<AND>(4,2) is an AND gate with four 2-bit inputs.
- LookaheadGenerator
    Computes all generate and propagate signals for 2 arbitrary-width inputs.
- SaveAdder
    Carry-save adder.

The following classes derive from Adder:
- RippleAdder
    Carry-ripple adder. Sub-adders can be any Adder (default is 1-bit FAs).
- SkipAdder
    Carry-skip adder. Sub-adders can be any Adder that provides a P output.
- SelectAdder
    Carry-select adder. Sub-adders can be any Adder.
- LookaheadAdder
    Carry-lookahead adder. Sub-adders can be any Adder that provides G and P.
- PrefixAdder
    Prefix adder using Kogge-Stone design.

--------------------------------------------------
Creating a custom module
--------------------------------------------------

If you want to create a black-box module to completely specify its behavior,
then derive from class Module.

You should implement the following methods:
 - Constructor, where you set `classname_` and define inputs and outputs.
 - propagate()
 - delay_t delay(int,int)
You may optionally define these methods:
 - delay_t load(int)
 - area_t area()
 - energy_t energy(int)
See "src/HA.h" for an example.

If you want to create a hierarchical module that contains sub-modules, then 
derive from class SystemModule. All you need to implement is a constructor, 
which defines inputs and outputs, and creates and connects sub-modules. 
See "src/FullAdder.h" for an example.

If you want to create an standard adder module, then derive from class Adder.
The inputs X, Y, and Ci, and outputs S and Co, will be defined for you.
You should implement a constructor as before, along with the clone() method.
This is so other adders can make copies of your adder to use as sub-modules.

--------------------------------------------------
Changing built-in parameters
--------------------------------------------------

The parameters for the standard logic gate classes are in "src/param.h".
Classes such as AND/OR/XOR as well as HA/FA use these parameters.
The parameter types are: delay, load-factor, area, energy.
Currently delays are integer values.
Area and energy are floating-point.
